- 🤖 Persian Electronic Music Composer & Graphic Digital designer In art World Called me : ILIA ConT 
- This title consists of two parts, ILIA & ConT.  Elijah is a Hebrew word, Syriac, meaning God, my God & I change this Word by my Taste to ILIA & ConT, taken from one of the strata of the royal artist of France & Count of St. Germain alchemist & artist of the eighteenth century . at The End Conte is Carbon Pencil.
- 🎨 From the age of 7, I went to an art class & started physical arts by Chiaroscuro. It has been an honor for me that at the age of 9 and 11 I have honorably held a painting gallery in the Chiaroscuro Method by Conte pencil, Crayons & Oil Painting from the Ministry of Culture & Arts of Iran & After Those Galley, I published several methods of my work style in several Persian painting books. 
- 👾 In the same years, I started working with digital software & making digital sketches & after some years Practicing with the development of my skills, I decided to build my dreams to started to work as a Ghost Vector Producer Team inside Vector websites to meet my financial needs.
- 🖊 I started making vector sketches from shutterStock & expanded my business to other websites such as Alamy, VectorStock, 123rf, and after 6 years of continuous operation, I produced & sold a large collection of over 7,000 2D BW model vectors. In 2020, due to issues such as the Corona epidemic, these websites changed the way they job contracted with the designers & I was forced to leave my business & relinquish the royalties to my products Cuase it was job roles at those website.
🧪 In the same year, we collaborated with another artist from different countries on an ArtStation art cast to design a fantasy game. 6 designers, 2 programmers, 2 animators & a team manager.Each designer had to design 4 examples of the game to different mobile characters in similar fields.After competing in a design contest & three months of trying to come up with ideas & design & Claim All Digital Assets, we couldn't win the contest due to the misuse of others and the secret disclosure of digital assets created by the team, & I had to deactivate my account.😔
- 🔰 I follow my old dream and in these 10 years of professional activity, I have created various art collections & single arts in different artistic ways, one of the newest of which is the Glamor area (A Part of J. R. R. Tolkien Products). Now on my Instagram I have written only a part of the single art & an example of the Hive of Algorithm collection with a deep concept that has been launched.
- 👆 It was only A part of my experience in Art Field 😇
